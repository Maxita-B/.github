Welcome to Max IT Barcaldine’s GitHub repository! This is where we share the public tools we use in our day-to-day operations. Our aim is to help others by making these tools accessible and easy to use. You’ll find that most of the tools here are written in PowerShell, reflecting our expertise and preference. We believe in the power of community and collaboration, so feel free to use, improve, and contribute to these tools. Let’s make technology work for us, together!

Yes, we used GPT for this. No we don't feel bad.
